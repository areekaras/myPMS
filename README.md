# Personal Management System (PMS) - Cross-Platform SwiftUI & Supabase App

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Personal Management System (PMS) is a cross-platform initiative designed to empower users with efficient personal organization. This application will feature robust expense tracking and goal-oriented sprint planning capabilities, providing a seamless experience across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

This project serves as my **proving ground for mastering advanced SwiftUI and full-stack integration with Supabase**. It's a key part of my journey to becoming an AI-assisted full-stack developer, allowing me to dive deep into modern declarative UI frameworks and backend-as-a-service solutions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Expense Tracking:** Intuitive interface for logging and categorizing daily expenses, with summaries and insights.
* **Goal-Oriented Sprint Planning:** Tools to define personal goals, break them down into actionable sprints, and track progress.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** A unified user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, leveraging SwiftUI's power.
* **Secure Authentication:** Seamless user login and management via Google Authentication.
* **Real-time Data Sync:** Utilizing Supabase for robust backend data storage and real-time updates across devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Architecture

This project is built with a strong focus on modern architectural patterns and cutting-edge technologies:

* **Frontend:**
    * **SwiftUI:** For building declarative, cross-platform user interfaces.
    * **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Employing this architectural pattern for clear separation of concerns, improved testability, and maintainable codebase.
* **Backend & Database:**
    * **Supabase:** A powerful open-source Firebase alternative providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, instant APIs, and real-time subscriptions.
* **Authentication:**
    * **Google Authentication:** Integrating secure and convenient user login.
* **Development Practices:**
    * **Modular Design:** Structuring the codebase into independent, reusable modules for better scalability and team collaboration (even in a solo project!).
    * **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Applying TDD principles to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability from the ground up.

## üìà My Learning Journey & Technical Deep Dive

This PMS project is a cornerstone of my full-stack metamorphosis. Here's what I'm actively learning and challenging myself with:

* **Mastering Advanced SwiftUI:** Exploring complex layout containers, custom views, animation, and performance optimization for cross-platform consistency.
* **Full-Stack Integration with Supabase:** Gaining hands-on experience with database schema design, real-time data synchronization, authentication flows, and serverless functions via Supabase.
* **Architectural Scalability:** Applying best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications, even as features grow.
